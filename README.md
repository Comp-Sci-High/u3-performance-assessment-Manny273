1. I picked this topic because I want to get extra credit for apcsa
2.
  A. First endpoint is "/" it basically is the home page for the api and gives a description into what I did
  B.Second endpoint is "/Docs" it basically gives all the paths for the api and makes sure that you can navigate it accordingly
  C.Third endpoint is /unit/:unitNum it basically gives the unit name the vocab, and some questions that you can use to practice with a dynamic parameter of unitNum with can be used for the units 1 through 8
  D. Fourth endpoint is unit/:unitNum/answers it gives the answer to the questions that were in the unit 
  E. Fifth endpoint is /unit/vocab/:unitNum it gives the the definiton to the vocab from the unit using a query parameter

3.My experience was alright it was decently fun and it became a nice side project
